# Name:
#   musicPreparator
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#   musicPreparator [-s] [source-path] [-d] [destination-path] [--skip]
#
# Arguments:
#   -s [--source]       Path to the directory/file as source to convert.
#                       In case it is a directory, from there a search starts recursively for music files.
#                       All found files will be added to the track list and processed by this.
#
#   -d [--destination]  Path to the directory where to build up (or continue to integrate) the new structure.
#                       All converted files will be placed here.
#   
#   --skip              Ignore a possible remain track list and start from the bottom up.
#
#
# Description:
#   A simple tool to convert music files and create a directory structure, based on the tracks information.
#   This script is focused on using MP3. Means it convert every given source music file into MP3 if possible.
#   To convert the track and extract the tag information, it use _ffmpeg_ and _ffprobe_.
#   The resulting directory structure at the destination place has the artist as first level, followed by the album.
#   This looks like this structure:
#       - destination
#           |- artist
#           |   |- album
#           |   |   | - artist-title.mp3
#           |   |   L - ...
#           |   |
#           |   |- album2
#           |   |   ...
#           |    ...
#           |- ...
#
#   The script is resistant for fails and interruptions.
#   Therefore it creates a list of all music files in the source directory and store it into a temporally file.
#   This file is placed into the current working directory and is only purged if the script ends successfully.
#   Missing music tag informations are replaced by default values, so at least the conversion was successful.
#   Local failures, like conversion problems, lead to skip the active selected music file.
#
# Problems:
#   Defining a directory as source leads to some not estimated errors, I couldn't fixed so far.
#   Therefore the usage of `find . --exec musicPreparator.sh -s {} ";"` is recommended.
#
